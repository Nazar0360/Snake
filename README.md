# Snake game

Everyone knows [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game. I just decided to write it myself.

## Controls

Use arrows to change direction of the snake movement, key `P` to pause and `R` to reset.

## Boosts

The `+` boost increases the length of the snake's tail and score by one.\
The `-` boost decreases the length of the snake's tail by one.\
The `?` boost increases the length of the snake's tail by a number from -2 to 2, the score increases by the same number adding a number from -1 to 1.

## Code

`main.py` is the main file that runs the game, but it uses the console. If you don't need the console, run `main.pyw` instead.

If you want to change the game and its rules, and you don't want or can't understand the code, you can just find the following comment ```# hint: explanation (example)``` (or ```'''hint: explanation (example)'''```) and change the value as in the example after the explanation.
